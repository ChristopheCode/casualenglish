English Learning App
About
English Learning App is a simple and educational tool designed to help students improve their English skills. Our app focuses on learning irregular verbs and we also have a project to help users learn synonyms and antonyms.

Currently, the project focuses on the frontend development of the app, but we plan to expand it over time.
